MoneyBox Tutorial
1. layout
2. cut the wood
3. glue the parts together
4. screw the bottom
5. color the box first layer
6. glue your infrared sensor
7. put in your hardware
8. draw the pixels
9. paint the pixelart on it :)

## if you want to make your own costum sounds follow the superb tutorial on https://highlowtech.org/?p=1963

## MoneyBox
## 1. layout

![part1-400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51839738/153498322-d41aa19a-7822-48ec-84c9-8f5459ff3cdb.jpeg)

make a box like in this example https://de.wikihow.com/Eine-Holzkiste-bauen no german skillz needed for the pictures.

## 2 cut the wood

![part2-400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51839738/153499010-4d637198-48a1-4b8a-b381-e79d648df92e.jpg)

Use a saw you like if possible one you can make clean cuts with, like a circular saw or a good jigsaw or if your are
comfortable enough use a hand saw.

## 3. glue the parts together

![part3-400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51839738/153499739-e9e8fa30-efbd-40df-8945-f49845dbe8e0.jpeg)

nothing really other to sayinfrared sensor then, glue the parts together :)

## 4. screw the bottom

![part4-400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51839738/153499869-d872f6ef-bdfb-473d-8788-0da4efaf0446.jpeg)

screw the botton together to make it more stable if you want to but glue could be sufficient aswell.
you can also use nails instead of screws.


## 5. color the box first layer

![part5-400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51839738/153500396-c1f125a4-5aea-4728-abd4-97b094f3d93c.jpeg)

color your box white to make it look better when you color it later with other colors 
I used acrylic colors.

## 6. glue your infrared sensor


![part6-400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51839738/153500629-efe14592-cf37-49f4-86b4-c506f3e02edd.jpeg)

next comes your infrared sensor. glue it to a new piece of infrared sensorwood and put it in the middle of the box, if you close your box it is under the hole where your change goes inside.
It will reflect and triggers the signal.


## 7. put in your hardwareinfrared sensor

![part7-400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51839738/153501250-c78d2f2e-56e3-43a0-9aea-2b74ccbd5065.jpeg)
![part12-400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51839738/153503516-590d6e50-992e-4392-ba62-e7a5900afb80.jpeg)

(later I changed with a bigger speaker because it was not loud enough otherwise.)

put in your existing hardware and put it in the smaller part of the box, drill a hole in the middle part of that wood, that way your connecting cables can connect to your Arduino. don't glue the middle wood part, safe that for later when you managed the place for your hardware and everything is working propely.

At last make a hole in the middle of the top of the box for your coin money to go inside :)

## 8. draw the pixels
![part8-400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51839738/153502027-1c454a92-3491-416e-a708-a103b61ad5f6.jpeg)


![part9-400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51839738/153502045-75cd89ac-92e0-43a6-9705-5ef6d8890e15.jpeg)

it's more easy to mark your end of the line on the other sides than to measure it again.
your pixelgrid shoud be 16x16 if you want the same style

## 9. paint the pixelart on it :)

![part10-400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51839738/153502996-5a992c59-d1f3-417b-be92-9eab55340730.jpeg)

I used 8 magnets to close the top and hold it stable. just drill some holes in the right size and put them inside with a
little bit of glue.

when your hardware is properly installed and glued, glue also your middle wood part with it to keep it stable.

manage to put the Infrared-Sensor right under the hole for the coins to get it triggered
